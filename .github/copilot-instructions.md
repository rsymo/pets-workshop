# Dog shelter

This is an application to allow people to look for dogs to adopt. It is built in a monorepo, with a Flask-based backend and Astro-based frontend.

## Backend

- Built using Flask and SQLAlchemy
- All routes require unit tests, which are created in *test_file.py* in the same folder as the file
- When creating tests, always mock database calls

## Frontend

- Built using Astro and Svelte
- Pages should be in dark mode with a modern look and feel
